In the world of front-end development, handling state can be tough but necessary. Redux has been a popular choice for a while, providing a way to manage state predictably and cache server data. However, using Redux meant dealing with lots of boilerplate code, with actions reducers and middleware functions especially as projects got bigger.

Redux required developers to define actions, reducers, and middleware in detail, leading to large codebases and sometimes duplicated data. While Redux was good at caching data, managing things like revalidation of data was manual and took a lot of time. Developers had to deal with tasks like retrying failed requests, polling for updates, and fetching data conditionally, all while making sure everything was thoroughly tested.

Then came React Query – a new way to handle state in React apps that changed the game. With React Query, developers can use simple React hooks to handle caching, revalidation, error handling, and running multiple queries at once. Its straightforward approach means less boilerplate code, letting developers focus more on building solid apps without getting bogged down by setup.

One of the great things about React Query is its flexibility. React Query can be added to existing projects without causing any disruptions. Whether you're fully committed to Redux or looking at other options like Jotai or Recoil, React Query can fit in smoothly, making your workflow better instead of getting in the way.

But React Query isn't just about caching external data – it's also good for managing state on the client side too. Testing custom React Query hooks is easy thanks to the React Hooks Testing Library, and its strong typing helps with code completion and clarity, giving better development experience.

While Redux Toolkit has made some improvements, it still follows the same mental model of store, actions and reducers. If you want something different, atomic state management tools like Jotai and Recoil offer interesting alternatives, with features like managing data in local storage, derived state and more.

In short, React Query is a simple and efficient solution for handling state in modern front-end development. Its user-friendly approach, wide range of features, and compatibility with other libraries make it my top choice. So, if you're starting a new React project, think about giving React Query a try – it could change the way you handle state.
