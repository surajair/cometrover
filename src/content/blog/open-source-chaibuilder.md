I am thrilled to share a significant update regarding the Chai Builder project — it’s now open source!

I embarked on this journey with Chai Builder in December 2021. After dedicating several months to its full-time development and later contributing on a part-time basis, I am excited to announce this major milestone. I couldn’t have achieved this without the invaluable support of a fellow colleague, who has been instrumental in this collaborative effort.

The project has reached a point where it is ready for others to take the reins and tailor it to their specific needs. I envision Chai Builder becoming not just a great website builder, but now, an exceptional open-source website builder.

Moving forward, I am committed to regular contributions to propel the project closer to the ambitious vision I had at its inception. However, the real magic lies in the collective efforts of the Chai Builder community. This is where you come in.

I invite you, to actively participate in its development. Your insights, feedback, and contributions can play a pivotal role in enhancing its stability and overall quality. Together, let’s simplify and redefine what it means to have the best website builder.

Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey, and I look forward to witnessing the incredible transformations that our community can achieve together.
