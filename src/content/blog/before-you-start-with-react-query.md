React-Query is a powerful library that makes it easy to manage and handle data in your React applications. Whether you're working on a simple website or a complex enterprise application, React-Query can help you improve the performance, scalability, and maintainability of your code. However, getting started with React-Query can be tricky, especially if you're new to some of the underlying concepts.

In this blog post, we'll take a look at four key concepts that are essential to understanding React-Query and how it works. By the end of this post, you'll have a solid foundation for using React-Query in your own projects, and you'll be well on your way to unlocking its full potential.

### **1- Javascript Promises**

The first concept to understand is that of Javascript Promises. React-Query relies heavily on the use of Promises to handle data retrieval and updates. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and it's used to handle the asynchronous nature of data retrieval.

### **2- React Hooks**

The second concept to understand is that of React Hooks. React-Query makes heavy use of hooks to handle state management, and you'll need to be familiar with the basics of hooks in order to use React-Query effectively. Hooks are a way to use state and other React features in functional components, and they're a powerful tool for managing data in your React applications.

### **3- React Context**

The third concept to understand is that of React Context. React-Query uses context to store and manage data, and you'll need to be familiar with the basics of context in order to use React-Query effectively. Context is a way to pass data down through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

### **4- State Management Concept**

The fourth and final concept to understand is that of state management. React-Query is a powerful tool for managing data and state in your React applications, and you'll need to understand the basics of state management in order to use React-Query effectively. State management is the process of handling and maintaining the state of your application.

In conclusion, React-Query is a game changer for React developers, but getting started can be tricky. Make sure to understand these 4 key concepts before diving in for full potential. With a solid understanding of Javascript Promises, React Hooks, React Context and State Management concept, you'll be well on your way to unlocking the full power of React-Query.
